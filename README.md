## Abstract
### Purpose
<p align="justify">
To prospectively assess the concordance of examination under anesthesia (EUA)-
based clinical T stage with pathological T stage and diagnostic accuracy of EUA in patients
with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.
</p>

### Methods: 
<p align="justify">
Consecutive patients with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy between June
2017 and October 2020 in a single academic center were included in a prospective study.
Two urologists performed EUA (one blinded to imaging) before patients underwent
cystectomy. We assessed the concordance between clinical T stage in bimanual palpation
(index test) and pathological T stage in cystectomy specimens (reference test). Sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were
calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to detect or exclude locally advanced bladder
cancer (pT3b-T4b) in EUA.
</p>

### Results

<p align="justify">
The data of 134 patients were analyzed. Given that stage pT3a cannot be palpated,
for the non-blinded examiner, T staging in EUA was concordant with pT in 107 (79.9%)
patients, 20 (14.9%) cases being understaged in EUA and 7 (5.2%) overstaged. For the
blinded examiner, staging was correct in 106 (79.1%) patients, 20 (14.9%) cases being
understaged and 8 (6%) overstaged. For the non-blinded examiner, sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, and NPV of EUA were 55.9% (95% CI 39.2-72.6%), 93% (88-98%), 73.1% (56-
90.1%), and 86.1% (79.6-92.6%), respectively; for the blinded examiner, they were 52.9%
(36.2-69.7%), 93% (88-98%), 72% (54.4-89.6%) and 85.3% (78.7-92%), respectively.
</p>

### Conclusion
<p align="justify">
Given that EUA could correctly determine bladder cancer T stage in 80% of
cases, its specificity and NPV, EUA should still be used for clinical staging.
